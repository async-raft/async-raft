/// The Raft API.
///
/// This type implements the full Raft spec, and is the interface to a running Raft node.
/// Applications building on top of Raft will use this to spawn a Raft task and interact with
/// the spawned task.
///
/// For more information on the Raft protocol, see
/// [the specification here](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) (**pdf warning**).
///
/// For details and discussion on this API, see the
/// [Raft API](https://async-raft.github.io/async-raft/raft.html) section of the guide.
///
/// ### clone
/// This type implements `Clone`, and should be cloned liberally. The clone itself is very cheap
/// and helps to facilitate use with async workflows.
///
/// ### shutting down
/// If any of the interfaces returns a `RaftError::ShuttingDown`, this indicates that the Raft node
/// is shutting down (potentially for data safety reasons due to a storage error), and the `shutdown`
/// method should be called on this type to await the shutdown of the node. If the parent
/// application needs to shutdown the Raft node for any reason, calling `shutdown` will do the trick.

    /// persisted in a well known location, probably alongside the Raft log and the application's
    /// state machine. This ensures that restarts of the node will yield the same ID every time.
    ///
    /// ### `config`
    /// Raft's runtime config. See the docs on the `Config` object for more details.
    ///
    /// ### `network`
