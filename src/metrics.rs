//! Raft metrics for observability.
//!
//! The `RaftMetrics` type derives the `actix::Message` type, so applications are expected to
//! implement a handler for receiving these metrics, and then should pass its
//! `actix::Receiver<RaftMetrics>` to the `Raft` instance constructor when starting a Raft node.
//!
//! The `RaftMetrics` type holds the baseline metrics on the state of the Raft node the metrics
//! are coming from, its current role in the cluster, its current membership config, as well as
//! information on the Raft log and the last index to be applied to the state machine.
//!
//! Applications may use this data in whatever way is needed. The obvious use cases are to expose
//! these metrics to a metrics collection system like Prometheus or Influx. Applications may also
//! use this data to trigger events within higher levels of the parent application.
//!
//! Metrics will be exported at a regular interval according to the
//! [Config.metrics_rate](https://docs.rs/actix-raft/latest/actix_raft/config/struct.Config.html#structfield.metrics_rate)
//! value, but will also emit a new metrics record any time the `state` of the Raft node changes,
//! the `membership_config` changes, or the `current_leader` changes.
