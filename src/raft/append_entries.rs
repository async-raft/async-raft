    /// An RPC invoked by the leader to replicate log entries (§5.3); also used as heartbeat (§5.2).
    ///
    /// This method implements the append entries algorithm and upholds all of the safety checks
    /// detailed in §5.3.
    ///
    /// Implementation overview from spec:
    ///
    /// 1. Reply `false` if `term` is less than node's current `term` (§5.1).
    /// 2. Reply `false` if log doesn’t contain an entry at `prev_log_index` whose term
    ///    matches `prev_log_term` (§5.3).
    /// 3. If an existing entry conflicts with a new one (same index but different terms), delete the
    ///    existing entry and all that follow it (§5.3).
    /// 4. Append any new entries not already in the log.
    /// 5. If `leader_commit` is greater than node's commit index, set nodes commit index to
    ///    `min(leader_commit, index of last new entry)`.
    ///
    /// The essential goal of this algorithm is that the receiver (the node on which this method
    /// is being executed) must find the exact entry in its log specified by the RPC's last index
    /// and last term fields, and then begin writing the new entries thereafter.
    ///
    /// When the receiver can not find the entry specified in the RPC's prev index & prev term
    /// fields, it will respond with a failure to the leader. **This implementation of Raft
    /// includes the _conflicting term_ optimization** which is intended to reduce the number of
    /// rejected append entries RPCs from followers which are lagging behind, which is detailed in
    /// §5.3. In such cases, if the Raft cluster is configured with a snapshot policy other than
    /// `Disabled`, the leader will make a determination if an `InstallSnapshot` RPC should be
    /// sent to this node.
    ///
    /// In Raft, the leader handles inconsistencies by forcing the followers’ logs to duplicate
    /// its own. This means that conflicting entries in follower logs will be overwritten with
    /// entries from the leader’s log. §5.4 details the safety of this protocol. It is important
    /// to note that logs which are _committed_ will not be overwritten. This is a critical
    /// feature of Raft.
    ///
    /// Raft also gurantees that only logs which have been comitted may be applied to the state
    /// machine, which ensures that there will never be a case where a log needs to be reverted
    /// after being applied to the state machine.
    ///
    /// #### inconsistency example
    /// Followers may receive valid append entries requests from leaders, append them, respond,
    /// and before the leader is able to replicate the entries to a majority of nodes, the leader
    /// may die, a new leader may be elected which does not have the same entries, as they were
    /// not replicated to a majority of followers, and the new leader will proceeed to overwrite
    /// the inconsistent entries.
