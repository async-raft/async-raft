// Raft //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// An actor which implements the Raft protocol's core business logic.
///
/// For more information on the Raft protocol, see the specification here:
/// https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf (**pdf warning**).
///
/// The beginning of ยง5, the spec has a condensed summary of the Raft consensus algorithm. This
/// crate, and especially this actor, attempts to follow the terminology and nomenclature used
/// there as precisely as possible to aid in understanding this system.
///
/// ### api
/// This actor's API is broken up into 3 different layers, all based on message handling. In order
/// to effectively use this actor, only these 3 layers need to be considered.
///
/// #### network
/// The network interface of the parent application is responsible for providing a conduit to
/// exchange the various messages types defined in this system. The `RaftNetwork` trait defines
/// the interface needed for being able to allow Raft cluster members to be able to communicate
/// with each other. In addition to the `RaftNetwork` trait, applications are expected to provide
/// and interface for their clients to be able to submit data which needs to be managed by Raft.
///
/// ##### raft rpc messages
/// These are Raft request PRCs coming from other nodes of the cluster. They are defined in the
/// `messages` module of this crate. They are `AppendEntriesRequest`, `VoteRequest` &
/// `InstallSnapshotRequest`. This actor will use the `RaftNetwork` impl of the parent application
/// to send RPCs to other nodes.
///
/// The application's networking layer must decode these message types and pass them over to the
/// appropriate handler on this type, await the response, and then send the response back over the
/// wire to the caller.
///
/// ##### client request messages
/// These are messages coming from an application's clients, represented by the
/// `messages::ClientPayload` type. When the message type's handler is called a future will be
/// returned which will resolve with the appropriate response type. Only data mutating messages
/// should ever need to go through Raft. The contentsof these messages are entirely specific to
/// your application.
///
/// #### storage
/// The storage interface is typically going to be the most involved as this is where your
/// application really exists. SQL, NoSQL, mutable, immutable, KV, append only ... whatever your
/// application's data model, this is where it comes to life.
///
/// The storage interface is defined by the `RaftStorage` trait. Depending on the data storage
/// system being used, the actor my be sync or async. It just needs to implement handlers for
/// the needed actix message types.
///
/// #### admin
/// These are admin commands which may be issued to a Raft node in order to influence it in ways
/// outside of the normal Raft lifecycle. Dynamic membership changes and cluster initialization
/// are the main commands of this layer.
